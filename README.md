# AutoHotKey Scripts

This repo contains some of the AHK scripts that I use.

`arrow_keys.ahk` was inspired by a blog post by [@nikitonsky](https://twitter.com/nikitonsky) that argues that the [cursor keys belong at the center of your keyboard](https://tonsky.me/blog/cursor-keys/). I tried the suggested approach and greatly enjoyed it, and have since added a bunch more nifty functionality to the script.

Hope some of those hotkeys are useful for you, and/or that they inspire you to create some of your own! :)
